/*
1.
Write a function, greetAliens(), that takes in an array of strings and uses a for loop to print a greeting with each string in the array.

The greeting should take the following format:
“Oh powerful [stringElement], we humans offer our unconditional surrender!”

const aliens = ["Blorgous", "Glamyx", "Wegord", "SpaceKing"];

greetAliens(aliens);
// Should print:
// Oh powerful Blorgous, we humans offer our unconditional surrender! 
// Oh powerful Glamyx, we humans offer our unconditional surrender! 
// Oh powerful Wegord, we humans offer our unconditional surrender! 
// Oh powerful SpaceKing, we humans offer our unconditional surrender! 

Note: You may have noticed how convenient it would be to use .forEach(), but you’re not allowed to use it here. Don’t worry you’ll have plenty of opportunities to use built-in methods later on!
*/

// Write your code here:
const greetAliens = arr => {
    for (let i=0; i <arr.length; i++) {
      console.log(`Oh powerful ${arr[i]}, we humans offer our unconditional surrender!`)
    }
  }
  
  
  // When you're ready to test your code, uncomment the below and run:
  
  const aliens = ["Blorgous", "Glamyx", "Wegord", "SpaceKing"];
  
  greetAliens(aliens);
